Things I changed in this submission and why!

1. Created a js file, webpage.js, to be able to add interactive elements to the page
2. Renamed the three files (webpage.html, webpage.css, webpage.js) to keep everything organized
3. Added interactive buttons in each category section which collapse or expand text/pictures, to add dynamic to the category sections
4. Changed the color between categories to increase visual distinction
5. Stacked the boxes vertically for a more adaptable layout, and also so the navigation bar can interactively bring the user to the section
6. Changed the title header to have a specialized greeting based on the time of day (Good Monring, afternoon, evening) to add a fun, lowkey event listener
7. Updated hover effects on the navigation bar and buttons to improve the visual aesthetic of the page
8. Added some additional text to keep the page balanced with the additions above
